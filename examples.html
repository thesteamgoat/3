      <td><div class="scroll">Deltas are formed from sediment deposited at the mouths of rivers. A flowing stream or river carries sediment to a lake or ocean. The flowing currents stop upon entering the larger body of water, and the sediment sinks to the bottom and builds new land, like spread fingers of a hand. The water velocity slows dramatically causing the sand, silt, and clay suspended in the river to precipitate out (settle to the bottom) with larger particles precipitating faster than smaller ones. This creates a fan-shaped area of deposition. The land formed in this process is called a delta.</div></td>
      <td><div class="scroll">A canyon is the high walls along a river and the river itself. The water in the river carries rocks and other sediments. Slowly, the rocks in the water are pushed along and erode the
sediments on the river bed. Over a long time, this erosion forms a valley. Over a longer period of time, the river carves deeper and deeper into the Earth's surface, and a canyon forms. This is how the Grand Canyon was formed by the Colorado River.</div></td>
      <td><div class="scroll">
        Sand dunes form in desert or beach regions from two processes: erosion, where wind constantly blows the sand from the long side of the dune facing the wind to the top of the dune; and deposition, where the wind stops and drops the remaining sand along the other side. Constant erosion and deposition cause the dune to slowly shift its position windward. Small dunes are found along sandy beaches. Enormous dunes can be found in large desert areas, such as the Sahara in Africa or the Gobi Desert in Asia.</div></td>
      <td><div class="scroll">
        A glacier is a huge piece of ice that slowly moves across the surface of the Earth and remains frozen during the entire year. Glaciers move very slowly across Earth's surface. As they move, glaciers scrape the land. Glaciers carry rocks that are frozen in the ice. These rocks scrape land, forming holes and glacier valleys.</div></td>
